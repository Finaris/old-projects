(Apparently I didn't know how to use any other method of communication back in the day)
HOW TO SEND FEEDBACK

1. Log into facebook (note that facebook will open on its own once you press any
   key to continue.
2. Go to your message creator and send a message to Madelyn Torres.
   Click the "Add Attachment" icon.
3. Once clicked, go to where you saved The Trivia Game (which is generally the
   desktop) and open it. Click the "FeedbackMus" or "FeedbackMec" file and press ok.
4. After the selected "Feedback" file loads, then you send the message!
